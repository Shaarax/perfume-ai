🧠 Project Title

Perfume AI: An Intelligent Fragrance Discovery Platform using AI and Structured Scent Data

📄 Summary

Perfume AI is a self-developed software project built by Mohd Shaarif Khan to address inefficiencies and consumer confusion in the global fragrance market. It combines structured perfume data with intelligent search and recommendation features to enable better scent discovery.
